1.INTRODUCTION
The use of machine learning techniques to forecast dengue virus cases has improved the accuracy of 
disease prediction, which is crucial for effective disease control and prevention. With the help of These 
Algorithms in the medical sector helps to analyze the disease and patterns of change with respective to 
time and severeness of Illness can be controlled by these techniques and early prediction of disease 
helps to tackle the situation efficiently. 
These methods play a vital role in recent outbreak of covid, and dengue fever is a leading worst scenario 
in the tropical areas of the world 390 million infections are occurring every year and there is no perfect 
treatment for this problem causing nightmare to the health sector. As a result, machine learning 
algorithms have become increasingly popular in recent times for predicting dengue virus cases. 
Choosing the most appropriate algorithm is important for ensuring accurate predictions. Typically, 
supervised, or unsupervised learning techniques are employed for dengue prediction. 
To predict future outbreaks, a novel dengue virus prediction system was developed by combining a 
conventional supervised machine learning model with a random forest algorithm in this study and a 
few other algorithms. The model was trained on demographic data and historical dengue cases. The 
study used in this research is original patient data deployed by the America health agency. To analyze 
the virus behavior over the years and Entire Research is done on the reference to Ethics Report, and 
cybersecurity aspects were considered during the entire research process

1.1. Virus History
Dengue fever spread through a virus from FLAVIVRIDAE family, and it was first discovered in 1943
(M.s & S, 2015) by Japanese scientists in Nagasaki. Few studies Tell it was evolved Before humans and
there is no convincing evidence to prove It, the microbe lies in the arthropods. This virus family is
responsible for Zika virus, chikungunya, and Yellow Fever. This Infection Enters into the human body
Through Blood stream and effects monocytes in The Immune system. Over the years it was evolved and
formed four stereotypes Denv1, Denv2, Denv3, Denv4.
1.2. Spread
The infection expansion was through Mosquitoes. It spreads through a Female Mosquito of AEDES
AEGYTI (Dash, et al., 2013) family, and its life span is 2 weeks. Male mosquitoes feed from nectar
present in flowers of a plant and female mosquitoes feed from the blood of humans and animals and
these are responsible for reproduction in their species, and it will feed maximum 3,4 times in lifetime.
The mosquito sucks blood from a patient with dengue fever and sucks to a healthy person for blood to
feed in the mean while the virus is transmitted through this process and causing spread of this virus.
Mosquitoes are the main carrier of this disease.

1.3. Infection Rate
A study says Due to this virus nearly 390 million (Barbosa & Sandra, 2020) infections are taking place
every year and among them 90 million are sick due to this virus 36000 deaths are caused every year.
(Guha-Sapir, 2005) It normally spreads in tropical areas in the world like South America, North
America, Asia, Australia, and Africa which is causing 40-50% of risk to the world population.

1.4. Vaccine and Treatment
Vaccine released and approved in eighteen countries. in 2016 WHO suggest avoiding the vaccine
because it is not defending the virus and recurring chances are high and Mentioned about the Types of
Dengue Fever Earlier. The vaccine of one variant will not be effective to another stereotype. This Virus
is Similar to covid Virus due to Various Mutant viruses (Webster, 2009) the vaccine is not effective. Till
now There is no effective Treatment for This fever only general treatment of using Paracetamol and
Hydrated liquids to the body. If a patient is attacked with a variant and recovered, he is immune to the
variant for the rest of his life and, but he does not have the immunity to other types of variants. children
with age 5-9 and adolescents from age 12-19 having fatality. Denv2 (Renantha, 2022) is the most lethal
type Which is having the highest Death toll.

1.5. Virus Mechanism
Even now it was a puzzle that why everyone will not be sick for dengue fever and only 20 percent of
infection gets sick. the virus enters in to the blood stream by the mosquito bite and it takes white blood
cells as the host and this germ creates a PH such that a pore is formed and virus penetrates in to the
WBC and it uses its energy and metabolism to replicate the virus cells thus Virus is grown inside the
body and effects the platelets and normal count is 450,000 (Ubol, 2010) per adult but this attacks on
platelets results in decrease in count and leads to death.

1.7. Research Question
1. Can we analyze the spread of dengue fever using various conditions and inputs?
2. How can machine learning algorithms help in early detection of dengue virus spread?
   
1.8. Objectives
Evaluate the current state of research in the medical field, including advancements and methods for
evaluation. Examine the available literature on the spread of dengue fever that utilizes machine learning
techniques. Use exploratory data analysis to gain valuable insights from the data. Assess the different
approaches used to improve the existing modelâ€™s performance and select the efficient one based on
predicted outcomes. Perform an analysis on the proposed model and compare it with an existing model.
Explore the benefits using these Techniques and suggest a secure workflow methodology to implement
alongside the machine learning model. Finally, identify potential areas for future research in this field.

2.Literature Review

Dengue fever is a significant public health concern in many tropical and subtropical regions around the
world. It is caused by the FLAVIVRIDAE virus and is transmitted through a flies called Aedes mosquito.
Dengue fever can cause severe flu-like symptoms, and in severe cases, it can lead to dengue hemorrhagic
fever, which can be fatal. The prevention and control of dengue outbreaks depend on accurate and
timely prediction of its occurrence.
Prediction algorithms have become a popular tool for predicting dengue outbreaks in recent years. The
effectiveness of different prediction algorithms in predicting dengue outbreaks has been investigated
in several studies. 
The use of these methods, particularly the random forest algorithm, can be a valuable tool for
forecasting and controlling the spread of dengue fever. However, it is important to note that these
algorithms should not be used in isolation, and other factors such as climate, population density, and
other environmental factors should also be considered when predicting dengue outbreaks and may
changes with change in environment, immunity of people.
All the above research conducted on the data of tropical regions of in Asia and South America but in this
study deals with the population in North America This Research study includes the promotion of factors
influencing the spread of the disease and is it possible that machine learning algorithms helps to tackle
the predict of virus outbreak early.
The virus evolves with time and the features may vary with the mutation (Dowd, 2015) and this is the
reason there is no treatment or the vaccine for this disease till now. and all the research done with
parameters related to that area and limited to that of people living in that area, not for complete set of
people.

4.CONCLUSION
This epidemic disease causing not only hospitalization and deaths but also making victims suffer for
extended period and recovery is also slow and making economic burden in the developing countries of
tropical region and this makes obstacle for the socio-economic sector this is why research on this fever
is necessary. The above analysis gave the factors influencing the spread of disease. The first discovery
of the virus was in 20th century and then from years of mutation the infection changed its structure and
evolved into many forms like Corona virus in 2019 to 2023 more than 21 mutations are seen similarly
so many evolutions are seen in this case too and few research studies says that new infection virus of
DENV5 also evolved. The above prediction of dengue cases done in this research using random forest
from the data of 1990 to 2010 in the cities of Iquitos and San Juan united states of America. With the
above Data analysis, we have seen the factors promoting the virus spread, but these are not fully evident
because the new updated virus may have varied reasons to spread and still scientists have not proved
why it is not fatal to all the patients. This Research is helpful for set of people Living in those conditions
and applicable to those for a set of time and conditions but not globally. In future to predict the future
spread of virus the previous data of patients and their living scenario, environmental conditions must
be updated and research on this topic must be continued to see the breakthrough for this virus
treatment or the manufacture of vaccine.
