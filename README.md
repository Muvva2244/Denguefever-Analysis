# Denguefever-Analysis
The use of machine learning techniques to forecast dengue virus cases has improved the accuracy of 
disease prediction, which is crucial for effective disease control and prevention. With the help of These 
Algorithms in the medical sector helps to analyze the disease and patterns of change with respective to 
time and severeness of Illness can be controlled by these techniques and early prediction of disease 
helps to tackle the situation efficiently. 
These methods play a vital role in recent outbreak of covid, and dengue fever is a leading worst scenario 
in the tropical areas of the world 390 million infections are occurring every year and there is no perfect 
treatment for this problem causing nightmare to the health sector. As a result, machine learning 
algorithms have become increasingly popular in recent times for predicting dengue virus cases. 
Choosing the most appropriate algorithm is important for ensuring accurate predictions. Typically, 
supervised, or unsupervised learning techniques are employed for dengue prediction. 
To predict future outbreaks, a novel dengue virus prediction system was developed by combining a 
conventional supervised machine learning model with a random forest algorithm in this study and a 
few other algorithms. The model was trained on demographic data and historical dengue cases. The 
study used in this research is original patient data deployed by the America health agency. To analyze 
the virus behavior over the years and Entire Research is done on the reference to Ethics Report, and 
cybersecurity aspects were considered during the entire research process
